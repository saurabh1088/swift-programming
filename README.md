# Swift Programming

A Swift package containing efficient implementations of common algorithms and data structure problems. This package provides optimized solutions for various programming challenges with detailed documentation, performance analysis, and comprehensive test coverage.

## Overview

This package includes implementations of:

- **Anagram** - Algorithms for detecting and working with anagrams
- **Arrays** - Array manipulation and processing utilities
- **Reverse** - String and array reversal algorithms
- **Sliding Window** - Efficient sliding window technique implementations

## Features

- ✅ Well-documented code with detailed performance analysis
- ✅ Comprehensive edge case handling
- ✅ Optimized time and space complexity
- ✅ Extensive test coverage
- ✅ Production-ready implementations

## Usage

This is a Swift Package Manager (SPM) library. Add it to your project by including it in your `Package.swift` dependencies.
